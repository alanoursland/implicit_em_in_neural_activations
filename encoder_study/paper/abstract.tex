Gradient descent on log-sum-exp (LSE) objectives performs implicit expectation--maximization (EM): the gradient with respect to each component output equals its responsibility. The same theory predicts collapse without volume control analogous to the log-determinant in Gaussian mixture models. We instantiate the theory in a single-layer encoder with an LSE objective and InfoMax regularization for volume control. Experiments confirm theoretical predictions. The gradient--responsibility identity holds exactly; LSE alone collapses; variance prevents dead components; decorrelation prevents redundancy. The model exhibits EM-like optimization dynamics in which lower loss does not correspond to better features and adaptive optimizers offer no advantage. The resulting decoder-free model learns interpretable mixture components, confirming that implicit EM theory can prescribe architectures, not merely explain them.
